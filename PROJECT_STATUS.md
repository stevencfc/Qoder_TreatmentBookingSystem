- ✅ **Logging**: Winston logger with structured logging capabilities
- ✅ **Security**: Helmet, CORS, rate limiting, input sanitization
- ✅ **Configuration**: Environment-based configuration management
- ✅ **Health Checks**: Detailed health monitoring endpoints

### 5. API Foundation ✅
- ✅ Express.js application with security middleware
- ✅ OpenAPI/Swagger documentation setup
- ✅ RESTful API structure with versioning
- ✅ Database connection and model initialization
- ✅ Graceful shutdown handling

### 6. Frontend Foundation ✅
